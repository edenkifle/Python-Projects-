Hi, I'm Eden 🙋🏾‍♀️ 🖐🏾, I'm a beginner coder who's passionate about learning and creating new projects using Python. I'm always looking for ways to improve my coding skills and explore new areas of programming.

On my GitHub page, you'll find a collection of my Python projects, ranging from small scripts to full-fledged applications. I'm always working on new projects and experimenting with new ideas, so be sure to check back often to see what I've been up to!

I'm also interested in collaborating with other programmers on GitHub, so feel free to reach out to me if you're interested in working on a project together. Let's learn and grow together as programmers!
